# Handwritten-Digit-Predictor
A machine learning-based digit recognition system that takes an image of a handwritten number (0-9) as input and predicts the digit using a trained neural network. It utilizes TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning, OpenCV for image processing, and the MNIST dataset for training.
